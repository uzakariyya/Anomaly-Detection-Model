# üõ¢Ô∏è Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection in Well Log Data

## üîç Project Overview
This project presents a **prototype application** for detecting anomalies in **well log data** using **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques.  
The goal is to identify irregular readings in geophysical well logs that may indicate lithological changes, borehole instability, or sensor errors.  

Two complementary models were implemented:
- **Isolation Forest (IF)** ‚Äì a tree-based unsupervised algorithm that isolates outliers efficiently.  
- **Autoencoder (AE)** ‚Äì a neural network-based approach that reconstructs normal patterns and flags deviations as anomalies.  

Both methods were compared across multiple wells to assess performance, anomaly overlap, and feature influence.
